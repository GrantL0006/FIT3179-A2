          The electricity consumption per capita is an important measure of a country's electric power consumption, it
          is strongly tied to the economic growth from a sustainable development perspective. The electricity
          consumption per capita is calculated based on the total electricity generations in the country from all
          sources, such as power plants, solar plants â€¦ etc., and subtracted the power losses in the distribution
          process such as electricity transmissions. The net electricity production in the country is divided by the
          mid-year population on the country, indicating the average electricity consumed by everyone. It is important
          to understand the energy consumption does not only reflect the amount of electricity usage by the population,
          but also show the development of a country. The electricity consumption is a sub-section of energy
          consumption, which includes not only the energy requires to live comfortably but is also includes the
          electricity consumptions to operate transportations and factories. </p>

            Above temporal line chart shows the overall change in total consumption per capita globally. As shown in the
            line chart, there is a significant increase in the electricity usage at the year of 2000. Where electricity
            becomes one of the dominant forms of energy and are heavily consumed globally. The stacked area chart shown
            above shows the breakdown of different electricity generation methods. Where the area depicts the
            contribution of each source over time to the total energy consumption. The line chart offers the
            interactivity to manually select a year interval on the chart where the stacked area chart would zoom in to

            From the stacked area chart, it depicts that the renewable energy has been the dominant electricity source
            since 1985 and continues to be one of the primary forms of electricity generation method. Some of the most
            recent green energy source such as solar and wind electricity generation only become viable generation
            methods in the recent years. This is reflected in the area chart where they only gradually to make some
            noticeable contributions starting from around 2010. Hydro and nuclear electricity consumption has been
            consistent through the years while coal and gas electricity generation have a gradual increase in the 2000s.
            Electricity generated through oil has the greatest change in the 2000s where the proportion at which
            electricity consumed that came from oil has increased more than 10 times compared to 1990s.

            To understand which country is the primary user of each respective energy production method, this can be
            found in the parallel plot depicted above. The parallel plot utilizes the data of energy consumption based
            on different electricity sources, which can consequently used to determine the electricity generation
            methods used in the country. For example, Australia has the highest electricity consumption portion coming
            from coal as shown in the parallel plot, which indicating coal electricity generation is the dominant method
            used in the country. Consequently, when closely examine, Australia would not be the major player in other

            Carbon emission is the major byproduct of electricity generation and is a matter that should not be
            neglected. It is found that the electricity production contributes to 25% of the total greenhouse gas
            emissions. While electric power generation is the second largest source of carbon emission. These carbon
            emissions from electric power plants are commonly due to the burning of coal, fossil fuels, oils, and gases.
            As such, countries with high electricity consumption generally would consequently have a larger carbon
            emission. Although solar and wind electricity generation can have less carbon emission, the efficiency of
            these two methods at producing electricity is far lower than traditional methods. On the left is a heat map
            that depicts the carbon emission of top 64 countries in the world since 1990 to 2018 sorted in alphabetical
            order. The heat map provides the ability to quickly identify which country produces high carbon emission and
            observing whether these countries reduce or increases carbon emission.<br><br>

            The below bar chart depicts the top 10 countries with highest electricity usage, where Iceland has an
            electricity consumption that is more than double than the second highest country, Norway. While the pie

            the largest two methods used in electricity generation, whereas green energy generation methods such as
            solar and wind still have lowest electricity generation contribution due to their respective technological
            limitations.

            Not all country consumes electricity the same amount as how much they are capable in producing. Some
            countries rely on importation from other countries to have enough resources for electricity production.
            While some countries have abundant natural resources to produce electricity, which enable them to export
            these resources to other countries in exchange of economic benefits. The Energy Consumption and Production
            scatterplot investigates the countries' capability to self-sufficiently produce electricity. As such, a
            parameter known as Energy Ratio is defined in the plot. The above plot is presented in a log-log scale and 
            an interactive feature to explore the variations in countries electrical consumption and production.

        <div class="ver-3-col-2">
          <p>
            Energy ratio is calculated by dividing total national electricity consumption by the total national
            electricity production capability. Countries with energy ratio lower than 1 meaning the country has the
            capability to produce more electricity than what is consumed in the nation. This implying the country has
            more energy resources. While countries with energy ratio above 1 meaning the country has limited resources
            to produce the required electrical consumption, meaning importation of energy resources are needed. For
            example, Australia ha energy ratio of 0.3, meaning Australia has an abundant energy source, which enable the
            country to export these resources to other nations.
